L. Severability: If it is determined that any paragraph or provision in this arbitration clause is
illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the other
paragraphs and provisions of this arbitration clause. The remainder of this arbitration clause shall continue in
full force and effect as if the severed paragraph or provision had not been included. Notwithstanding this
severability provision, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines paragraph G to be void, illegal, invalid,
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that paragraph G above shall not be severed and that this arbitration clause
shall be void in its entirety.

M. Right to Opt Out: If I do not want this arbitration clause to apply, I may reject it by mailing a
written notice to you that lists my name, address and account number and states that I am opting out of the
arbitration clause. An opt out notice is only effective if it is signed by me, and the envelope that the opt out
notice is sent in is postmarked no more than 30 calendar days after the date I sign this Note. If I opt out of this
arbitration clause, it will not affect any other provisions of the Note or my obligations under the Note. If I do
not properly opt out as set forth above, it will be effective as of the date of the Agreement. If I opt out of this
arbitration clause, such election shall apply only to this Note, and not to any other past, present or future
agreements I have with you.
