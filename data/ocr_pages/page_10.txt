report on me for any legal purpose in connection with this Note, including any update, extension of credit,
review, or collection of this loan. If I request, you will tell me whether any credit report was requested, and if
so, the name and address of the credit bureau furnishing the report. If I believe that you have information
about me that is inaccurate or that you have reported or may report inaccurate information about me to a credit
bureau, I will notify you of the specific information that I believe is inaccurate by writing to you care of
Upstart Loan Operations, P.O. Box 1503, San Carlos, CA 94070. In doing so, I will identify the inaccurate
information and tell you why I believe it is incorrect. If I have a copy of the credit report that includes the
inaccurate information, I will send a copy of that report to you as well.

16. Governing Law. I understand and agree that FinWise is an FDIC-insured institution located in Utah.
Consequently, the provisions of this Agreement (except for Section 17) will be governed by federal law and (to
the extent not preempted by federal law) the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to conflict of law rules,
except as noted above. Section 17 (Arbitration Agreement) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and not
by any state law concerning arbitration. If any provision of this Note cannot be enforced, the rest of the
provisions of this Note will stay in effect. No amendment of this Note will be valid unless in writing and
signed by both you and me. This Note represents the entire agreement between you and me regarding my loan.
