drafts or checks, as provided in Section 4 below; thento any late charges then due; then to any interest then
due; and then to principal. Although the principal amount of my loan includes the origination fee, no unpaid
interest or other charges will be added to principal.

3. Interest. Periodic interest will be charged on unpaid principal until the full amount of principal has
been paid. Interest under this Note will accrue on a daily basis on the unpaid principal balance (including my
origination fee) set forth above. Because of the accrual of interest on any late payments and the effect of
rounding, my final payment may be more (or less) than my regular payment. I acknowledge that if I make my
payments after the scheduled due date, this Note will not amortize as originally scheduled, which may result in
a substantially higher final payment amount. The interest rate I will pay will be the rate I will pay both before
and after any default unless and until my loan is charged off.
